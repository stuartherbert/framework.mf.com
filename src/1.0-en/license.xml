    <para>
      We know it can be hard to work out what terms some projects are licensed under, and that this can be important when deciding whether or not to use code from a project for the first time. As a result, we have clearly set out our licensing terms below.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Methodosity Framework is an open source project.  We want you to be able to incorporate our code into any type of project (commercial or otherwise) without worrying about how using our code impacts the terms you can offer your own code under.
    </para>

    <para>
      We also want to ensure that everyone can always freely obtain our documentation, and that you are free to correct and improve upon our documentation as well.
