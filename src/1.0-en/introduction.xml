    Welcome to the Methodosity Framework's manual.
  </para>

  <para>
    The Methodosity Framework is both an application framework and a generic component library for PHP applications. It has been created for PHP developers who want to re-use the PHP skills they already have.  It is guided by <link linkend="goals">a clear set of goals</link> (which you will find later in this manual) and by a sense of practicality. It is simple, elegant, and robust.
  </para>

  <para>
    At Methodosity, we understand the importance of documentation. We believe that high-quality documentation is one of PHP's killer features, and we believe that creating similar documentation is just as important if our framework is to be as successful. This manual combines both tutorial and reference information, and compliments the <ulink url="http://framework.methodosity.com/1.0/phpdoc/">class documentation</ulink> generated by PHPDoc.
  </para>
  <para>
    We will keep this manual up to date with the latest features and framework capabilities as they are released.

    We hope you find the Methodosity Framework useful.  If you do, please tell your friends about it. Mention it on Twitter and Facebook, blog about it, and mention it at user group meetings and conferences. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
    If you find a bug, please tell us about it, so that we can make our framework even better. You can file bugs against the individual components on GitHub (<ulink url="http://github.com/stuartherbert">http://github.com/stuartherbert</ulink>), or contact the author via email at stuart (at) stuartherbert.com.
